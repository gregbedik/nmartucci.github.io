    <h1>A Page About the Mantis Shrimp</h1>
    <div class="left">
        <p>Mantis shrimp or stomatopods are marine crustaceans, the members of the order Stomatopoda. Most species can grow to around 10 centimetres (3.9 in) in length, though a few species reach up to 38 cm (15 in). The largest ever caught has a length of 46 cm (18 in) in the Indian River near Fort Pierce, Florida of USA. The carapace of mantis shrimp covers only the rear part of the head and the first four segments of the thorax. There are more than 450 species of Mantis shrimp. Varieties range from shades of brown to vivid colours, and are among the most important predators in many shallow, tropical and sub-tropical marine habitats. Despite being common, they are poorly understood as many species spend most of their life tucked away in burrows and holes.</p>

       <h3>Facts About The Mantis Shrimp</h3>
    <li>Compared to the three types of color receptive cones that humans possess in their eyes, the eyes of a mantis shrimp carry 16 types of color receptive cones. This gives the crustacean the ability to recognize colors that are unimaginable by other species</li>
       <li>Mantis shrimp are long-lived and exhibit complex behavior, such as ritualised fighting. Some species use fluorescent patterns on their bodies for signaling with their own and maybe even other species, expanding their range of behavioral signals.</li>
    <li>In Japanese cuisine, the mantis shrimp species Oratosquilla oratoria is eaten boiled as a sushi topping, and occasionally, raw as sashimi; and is called shako.</li>
       <li>They are commonly separated into two distinct groups determined by the manner of claws they possess, which are Smashers and Spearers.</li>
       <li>During mating rituals, mantis shrimp actively fluoresce, and the wavelength of this fluorescence matches the wavelengths detected by their eye pigments. Females are only fertile during certain phases of the tidal cycle; the ability to perceive the phase of the moon may therefore help prevent wasted mating efforts. It may also give mantis shrimp information about the size of the tide, which is important to species living in shallow water near the shore.</li>
